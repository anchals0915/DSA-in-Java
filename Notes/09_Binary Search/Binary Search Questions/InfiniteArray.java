 * Find position of an element in a sorted array of infinite numbers
 * 
 * Suppose you have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an
 * element in the array?
 * 
 * Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search,
 * but the problem here is that we donâ€™t know size of array.
 * If the array is infinite, that means we donâ€™t have proper bounds to apply
 * binary search.
 * So in order to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply
 * binary search algorithm.
 * 
 * Let low be pointing to 1st element and high pointing to 2nd element of array,
 * Now compare key with high index element,
 * ->if it is greater than high index element then copy high index in low index
 * and double the high index.
 * ->if it is smaller, then apply binary search on high and low indices found.
 *
